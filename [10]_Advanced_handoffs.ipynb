            "Ah, a fundamental concept in physics! Let's break down **centripetal force**.\n",
            "\n",
            "In simple terms, **centripetal force is the net force that causes an object to move in a curved or circular path.**\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Direction:** The key characteristic of centripetal force is that it always points **towards the center of the circular path**. The word \"centripetal\" itself comes from Latin, meaning \"center-seeking.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **What it Does:** An object moving in a circle is continuously changing its *direction* of motion, even if its *speed* is constant. A change in direction is an acceleration. According to Newton's Second Law ($\\text{F} = \\text{ma}$), for there to be an acceleration, there must be a net force acting on the object. This net force, which causes the object to accelerate towards the center of the circle, is the centripetal force.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Not a New Type of Force:** It's important to understand that centripetal force isn't a new fundamental force like gravity or electromagnetism. Instead, it's a *role* that an existing force plays.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   When a satellite orbits the Earth, **gravity** provides the centripetal force.\n",
            "        *   When you swing a ball on a string in a circle, the **tension in the string** provides the centripetal force.\n",
            "        *   When a car goes around a curve, the **static friction** between the tires and the road provides the centripetal force.\n",
            "        *   When an electron orbits a nucleus, the **electrostatic force** provides the centripetal force.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Formula:** The magnitude of the centripetal force ($\\text{F}_\\text{c}$) required to keep an object of mass ($\\text{m}$) moving in a circle of radius ($\\text{r}$) at a tangential speed ($\\text{v}$) is given by:\n",
            "\n",
            "    $\\text{F}_\\text{c} = \\frac{\\text{mv}^2}{\\text{r}}$\n",
            "\n",
            "    Alternatively, if you know the angular velocity ($\\omega$, in radians per second), the formula is:\n",
            "\n",
            "    $\\text{F}_\\text{c} = \\text{m}\\omega^2\\text{r}$\n",
            "\n",
            "    This formula shows that:\n",
            "    *   A larger mass requires more centripetal force.\n",
